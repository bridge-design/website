This documentation covers global design system aspects, token usage, guidelines, and examples of implemented components. Additionally, we incorporated workflows for design system maintenance and future extensions, enabling the team to evolve the system effortlessly.\n\n## Streamlined Development Process\n\nWith a focus on enhancing efficiency, we set up a robust development process. Our team equipped the project with essential tools, automated processes, and integration capabilities such as continuous testing and continuous delivery. This seamless development pipeline maximized productivity and minimized potential bottlenecks.\n\n## Testing with Jest\n\nTo ensure the reliability and stability of our components, we implemented rigorous testing using Jest. This comprehensive testing framework allowed us to identify and rectify any issues promptly, guaranteeing a seamless user experience.\n\n## Visual Regression Testing\n\nAs part of our commitment to perfection, we incorporated visual regression testing into our development workflow. By comparing visual snapshots of components, we could detect any unintended visual changes, ensuring that the design system's integrity was maintained throughout updates and modifications.\n\n## Team Trainings and Knowledge Sharing\n\nTo foster a culture of continuous learning, our project embraced transparency and knowledge sharing. We conducted team trainings and organized special knowledge-sharing events, ensuring that the expertise gained during the project was effectively communicated to AppOmni's in-house designers and developers.\n\n## Design System Integration\n\nAs a testament to the success of our project, the design system components seamlessly integrated into AppOmni's extensive product codebase. This integration solidified the impact of our work, as the design system became an integral part of the entire product range, enhancing user experiences and brand consistency.","title":"AppOmni Design System","layout":"LayoutCase","team":["varya","irina","alexandra"],"logo":"/logo/appomni-logo.svg","description":"Transformed AppOmni's user interfaces with an innovative design system.

That role also includes elements\nof service design and managing the project.\n\n## Data-driven approach and OKRs\n\nThe project goals are set and tracked by the [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) framework.\nMainly, the focus of design system team was to increase the adoption of its\nproducts (libraries of components implemented in different technologies) across the\ncompany. Such an approach assumed creating and constant usage of the metrics system.\nThe metrics such as amount of products using different libraries and amount of library\ncomponents used in these products — are frequently and regularly analysed to find out\nthe potential gaps and forward the team focus to close them.\n\n## Marketing and in-house community management\n\nAs a head of the product, Varya ensured its usage within the company and popularity in the\ndesign and development circles. While the usage of the design system is not mandatory,\nit turns out to be very important that people use it on their own will and, at first,\nget familiar with it. As specific actions towards this goal, Varya committed the following:\n\n- Representing the design system to the business levels and communicating its value and impact\n- Presenting and reminding about the design system in company's design and development forums\n- Regular onbording meeting for recently joined engineers\n- Processing the other teams' request to meet their expectations\n\n## Service design for a design system\n\nProject innovations were driven and tackled by applying service design techniques such as:\n\n- User research\n- Ideation\n- Prototyping\n- Facilitation\n\n## Accomplishments and Overcoming Challenges\n\n- Creation of a New Web Components Library\u003cbr/\u003e\nAs a product owner and project manager, Varya guided the team to successfully engineer a comprehensive\nlibrary of Web Components, enabling seamless integration into products regardless of the frontend\nframework they employ.\n\n- Workflow Definitions\u003cbr/\u003e\nVarya took the initiative to define and document the workflows for both our design system team operations\nand contribution. These visual and written artifacts provide vital guidance for both new and established\nteam members, fostering a collaborative environment and encouraging contributions to the design system.\n- Regular Onboarding Sessions\u003cbr/\u003e\nThanks to our continuous engagement, [the onboarding session has become a recognized recurring event\non the company calendar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6896797119584329728/). \nRegularly review and update the materials presented ensure the needs of newcomers are met, providing\nthem with relevant information about our design system. This in turn facilitates their integration into our\nworkflow and promotes wide adoption of the design system within product codebases.\n- Security Policy Development\u003cbr/\u003e\nRecognizing the importance of security, Varya organized a series of workshops where our team performed an\ninitial audit of resources and tools in relation to potential security threats. By creating a structured\nrepresentation of artifacts, risks, impacts, countermeasures, and response actions, Varya has enabled all\nteam members to understand and effectively manage various security scenarios.","title":"METRO Design System","layout":"LayoutCase","team":["varya"],"logo":"/logo/metro-logo.svg","description":"Metro Design System is a multiperspective product for designers and developers that helps them create digital experience for millions of METRO customers in 22 countries.\n"},{"date":"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)","slug":"elisa","content":"\nRenewal design system project at Elisa took place in 2020 and 2021.
