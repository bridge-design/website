They diligently counted the number of training programs delivered, essentially ticking off a checklist of activities. However, this metric didn't resonate with upper management.

This approach is akin to ticking boxes off a checklist: create a button, a dropdown menu, a modal, etc. The team's success would be measured by how many components they've developed and released. While this method ensures the delivery of tangible assets, it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual effectiveness or integration of those components in real projects."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"A more meaningful measure is the adoption rate of the design system, focusing not just on the output but on the outcome.
