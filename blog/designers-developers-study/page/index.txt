c:T533,The “wideness of expertise” dimension attracts the most. It is noticeable that designers and developers very much value if their colleagues have some knowledge in their area of expertise. These facts resonate with the findings of factors of successful collaboration between UX designers and UI developers. There, the developers complained about “designers do not know enough about the technical limitations when designing solutions” (Jones, 2019). In particular, the developers mentioned that static designs tend “to lack necessary details about the interaction layer in-browser” (Jones, 2019). Similarly, another research mentions the developers’ complaint regarding collaboration with designers as “designers usually don’t take into account the dynamic nature of the data” (Jones, Volker & Gemma, 2016) Generally, the sharing discipline specific knowledge “allows for in-depth discussions about the technical opportunities and constraints of different ideas” (Jones, 2019) and “collaboration is usually smoother when the designer is aware of the developer’s constraints and possibilities” (Maudet et al. 2017) .Correspondingly, the recommendations’ analysis shows that developers value “prototyping” skills of designers which would bring them dynamic designs including the interaction details.2:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",\"headline\":\"What UX designers and UI developers value in each other.
