On November 20th, 2025, we gathered for another **Design Systems Breakfast** — our friendly morning meetup for UX designers and UI developers to share coffee, ideas, and insights.

This session featured [**Fernando Vía Canel**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-via-canel/), a frontend engineer that loves design, who brought an incredible wealth of experience in building and scaling design systems. Fernando co-founded the design system at Klarna and helped scale the design system of the UI of Minecraft Bedrock.
