Welcome to our next **Design Systems Breakfast** featuring
[**Andy Cetnarskyj**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewcetnarskyj/)!

Andy will walk us through **Supernova and how they use
it to centralize design documentation and design tokens**.
This will be a practical overview of the tool and the
features they rely on. If you're curious about how teams
structure docs and tokens in one place, this is a great
chance to hear a real-world take.

As usual, our session will be relaxed and discussion-friendly.
Designers, developers, and anyone involved in design systems
are welcome. Grab your coffee and join the conversation!
