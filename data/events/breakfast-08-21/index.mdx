On August 20th, 2021, we returned from the summer break with another **Design Systems Breakfast**, a casual meetup for designers and developers to connect, share, and start the day together.

This session was hosted by **Varya Stepanova** and her colleague **Sherif Saleh**. Instead of inviting a guest speaker, they prepared and delivered the presentation themselves, focusing on creating space for the community to engage. A collaborative Miro board was used to capture ideas and encourage participation.

The discussion was informal and interactive, with participants sharing perspectives and experiences around design systems. The relaxed format highlighted the community-driven nature of the series and encouraged attendees to consider stepping forward as future speakers.
