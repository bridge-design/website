On January 20th, 2021, we kicked off the very first **Design Systems Breakfast**, setting the stage for a new series of informal community meetups.

This session featured [**Varya Stepanova**](http://varya.me/), who presented on **Design Tokens and Component Driven Development**. The talk explored how to ensure design tokens are used consistently across tools like Figma and development environments, versioning challenges, and strategies for linking tokens across different levels of abstraction.
