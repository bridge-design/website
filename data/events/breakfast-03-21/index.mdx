On March 18th, 2021, we hosted the third **Design Systems Breakfast**, welcoming design system professionals to another casual morning session.

Our guest, [**Wouter van der Kamp**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wouter-van-der-kamp-b956b935/), UX Lead & Product Owner Design System at **Aegon**, presented on **“Design systems; the business side.”** He shared his perspective on measuring the impact of design systems and how to communicate their value beyond implementation.

The talk led to an active discussion with the community:

- Participants suggested KPIs beyond velocity, such as **designer and developer satisfaction**.
- Others highlighted **time to production** as a practical measure when using a design system.
- Ideas for tracking contributions included JIRA labels, Git/Abstract PRs, and even lightweight forms for design input.
- Social recognition was also raised as an important motivator within teams.

The reflections showed how each team approaches measurement differently, but all agreed that the true value of a design system comes from **using it effectively, not just building it**.

Participants left the session energized, thanking Wouter for his insights and noting how the discussion gave them new perspectives on the business impact of design systems.
