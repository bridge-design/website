On January 29th, 2025, we gathered again for another **Design Systems Breakfast** — our friendly morning meetup for UX designers and UI developers to share coffee, ideas, and insights.

This session, [**Margo Roi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/margo-roi), a Ukrainian Web Engineer based in Helsinki, shared details about her own project, [FinUA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/finuaorg/) and their approach to documenting design systems in Notion. The project, built by volunteers, relies on simple, pattern-based structures to keep things consistent and easy to maintain — and Margo walked us through how this setup helps the team stay efficient and collaborative.

The session was lively and interactive, with Margo showing step by step how their processes have evolved and how the design system speeds up work in a non-commercial environment. It was a fantastic opportunity to connect, learn, and enjoy some coffee together.
