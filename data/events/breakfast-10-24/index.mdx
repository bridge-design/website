This time, Rafael Sepeda Errera (https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelsepeda) joined us with a talk on “How to build a strategy, not a roadmap.” His perspective opened up a great conversation about how design systems can be more than just checklists — focusing instead on big-picture strategy, flexibility, and long-term impact.
