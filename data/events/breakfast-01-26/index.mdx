Welcome to our next **Design Systems Breakfast** featuring [**Slava Shkodin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladislav-shkodin-0250b84a/), a Frontend Tech Lead with 15+ years of experience in frontend development!

Slava will be diving into: **"Extending components in a safe manner. How to provide flexibility to a design system, while not sacrificing its strictness"**

## Why this matters

"Flexibility vs. consistency" is one of the hardest design system tensions. If extension points are unclear or unsafe, teams either fork components or ship one-off UI... both paths slowly erode the system. Getting this right makes adoption easier, upgrades safer, and collaboration smoother.

The session will be development-focused, but not hardcore. We welcome other design system trades: designers, PMs, and any role. We'd love your input in the discussion!

Join us for another relaxed morning meetup and great conversation.
