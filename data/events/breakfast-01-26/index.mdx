The **Design Systems Breakfast** featured [**Slava Shkodin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladislav-shkodin-0250b84a/), a Frontend Tech Lead with 15+ years of experience in frontend development!

Slava dove into: **"Extending components in a safe manner. How to provide flexibility to a design system, while not sacrificing its strictness"**

## Why this mattered

"Flexibility vs. consistency" is one of the hardest design system tensions. If extension points are unclear or unsafe, teams either fork components or ship one-off UI... both paths slowly erode the system. Getting this right makes adoption easier, upgrades safer, and collaboration smoother.

The session was development-focused, but not hardcore. We welcomed other design system trades: designers, PMs, and any role, and valued everyone's input in the discussion.

It was another relaxed morning meetup with great conversation.
