In "Impact Players," Liz Wiseman uses a specific example of a department responsible for training employees to
illustrate her point about the difference between task completion and goal aiming. Initially, this department
measured its success based on the quantity of training sessions provided, a classic example of focusing on
task completion. They diligently counted the number of training programs delivered, essentially ticking off
a checklist of activities. However, this metric didn't resonate with upper management. The reports generated
by the department, which focused on these quantitative measures, failed to capture the interest or attention of
senior leaders. This situation is a classic example of how focusing solely on task completion can lead to a
disconnect with organizational goals and fail to demonstrate real impact.

The shift occurred when the department changed its key performance indicator (KPI) to measure the actual
educational advancement of the employees – a goal-aiming approach. This new metric aligned more closely with
the broader organizational objectives of enhancing employee skills and capabilities. By focusing on the outcome
of training – the improved education level of employees – rather than just the output (number of training
sessions conducted), the department's work suddenly became much more relevant and impactful from the
perspective of the upper management. This change in measurement criteria underscored the value of understanding
and aligning with the organization’s larger goals. It demonstrated how shifting focus from mere task completion
to aiming for overarching objectives can create a more meaningful impact and garner greater support and
recognition from higher-ups in the organization.

This concept mirrors the challenges in managing design systems.
In a task-oriented approach to a design system, the focus would be on the release of a certain number of
components. Here, the team would concentrate on the specifics – creating individual UI elements, documenting
them, and ensuring they are available for use. This approach is akin to ticking boxes off a checklist: create
a button, a dropdown menu, a modal, etc. The team's success would be measured by how many components they've
developed and released. While this method ensures the delivery of tangible assets, it doesn't necessarily
reflect the actual effectiveness or integration of those components in real projects.

A more meaningful measure is the adoption rate of the design system, focusing not just on the output but on
the outcome.
This perspective aligns more closely with the overarching objective of a design system, which is to streamline
and improve the design and development process across an organization. Instead of merely counting the number of
components created, the team's efforts would be directed towards how these components are being utilized in
projects, how they enhance consistency and efficiency, and how they can be improved based on user feedback. In
this approach, the team would measure success not just by output (number of components) but by outcome (rate of
adoption and improvement). This would lead to a more dynamic, user-focused design system, constantly evolving
in response to the needs of its users and the goals of the organization.

To transition from a task-oriented to a goal-oriented approach in managing a design system,
it's essential to have clear data on the system's adoption and usage. Understanding and improving this
aspect of the design system requires gathering accurate data on how developers are using the system,
which components are most popular, where gaps might exist, and how the system influences the efficiency
and consistency of development work.

Tracking the adoption rate is crucial for understanding a design system's impact and effectiveness
within an organization. Here are some methods for tracking:

Tracking the adoption rate of a design system is crucial for understanding its impact and effectiveness within an organization. Here are some methods that a design system team can use to track this rate:

1. **Regular Surveys**,
2. **Using 3rd-party Tools**,
3. **Gathering Own Stats via an Injected Script**,
4. **Gathering Stats Using GitHub Search**.

Each of these methods has strengths and weaknesses.

### Tracking Using Surveys

Surveys provide a direct channel to gather feedback from teams using the design system.
They can be structured to inquire about the frequency and manner of component usage, offering qualitative
insights into user satisfaction and potential areas for improvement. 

### Tracking Using 3rd-Party Tools

3rd-party tools offer a more data-centric perspective. Tools like [Omlet](https://omlet.dev/),
[Componly](https://componly.co/), and [Stylebit](https://stylebit.io/adoption) provide analytics and
insights into the usage patterns of design system components across various projects. These tools can
track specific components' usage, customization, and performance, offering quantitative data that is
objective and insightful for understanding system implementation.

### Tracking Using Injected Script

The method of using an injected script involves integrating a custom script into the development environment.
This script collects data on component usage, frequency, and context, providing real-time, accurate data
directly from the source. This approach is highly customizable, allowing teams to tailor the tracking to
their specific needs.

### Tracking Using GitHub Search

For organizations utilizing GitHub, searching within the organization's repositories can reveal how
extensively and in what ways the design system is being used. This method offers a broad, non-intrusive
overview of adoption, requiring no additional tooling or scripts.

When comparing these methods, several factors come into play:

- **Accuracy and Depth of Data**: While surveys provide valuable qualitative insights, 
hey rely on self-reporting and may not always be accurate or unbiased. In contrast, 3rd-part
 tools and injected scripts offer more objective, quantitative data. GitHub search, while convenient,
 might not provide the depth of data that other methods offer.

- **Technical Complexity and Resource Requirements**: Injected scripts require significant technical
know-how and ongoing maintenance, which may not be feasible for all teams. 3rd-party tools also require
integration into the development workflow but are generally easier to implement than custom scripts.

- **Privacy and Security Considerations**: Injecting scripts into the development environment raises concerns
about privacy and security. It's crucial to ensure these scripts do not infringe on developers' privacy or
compromise security. 3rd-party tools may also raise similar concerns.

- **Real-Time Insights**: Injected scripts provide real-time data, offering a dynamic view of component
usage. In contrast, GitHub search results are limited to the latest code updates in the repositories,
and surveys provide periodic insights.

- **Ease of Use and Accessibility**: GitHub search is straightforward and accessible to anyone with
repository access, making it a user-friendly option. Surveys are also relatively easy to implement and
participate in, compared to the technical requirements of scripts and some 3rd-party tools.

The choice of tracking method depends on the specific needs of the design system team, the resources available,
and the organization's policies on data privacy and security.


## What is next?

As we embark on the journey of gathering data, the path ahead is both intriguing and complex. The accumulation of
this data is only the beginning. The real task lies in transforming these raw numbers and feedback into meaningful,
actionable strategies.
This is a vast and multifaceted topic,
encompassing areas such as data analysis, strategic planning, and iterative development.
Many questions arise. Why are certain components more popular? Why some are neglected?
Are the tokens adopted and widely used?
The answers to these questions are keys to unlocking a more efficient, user-centric, and impactful design system.

For those seeking guidance and inspiration on this journey, resources such as the
[Future of Design Systems 2023](https://intodesignsystems.gumroad.com/l/thefutureofdesignsystems) conference are
invaluable. Talks like the one by Varya Stepanova and Daniel Miebach on
[Data-Driven Design System Management](https://app.pitch.com/app/public/player/3899f1a0-cd01-45b5-baab-51cc83fab3e7)
offer a glimpse into the practical aspects of this approach.
