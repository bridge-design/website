<LayoutHandout title="Library & product update">

The designers prepared you a new challenge! You have to provide
dramatic brand changes to the whole product. Let's do one by one,
similarly to previous exersices.

### 1. Update the tokens

### 2. Re-code the components

Work with your library of components in Storybook to align them
with new design.

### 3. Release the library

If you need a refresher, check [release page](../releasing-library)

### 4. Update the product

Bring the changes into your product. Now when it depends on tokens, it should not be too complicated!

## Goals

Overall you have 1 hour for the following tasks:

- Update your product with tokens (as described at [Product Update](../product-update) page)
- When your designers will share with you the design updates, which you will need to bring into your library and product. The process is described on this page.
- Release the new version of library and product. Read here about [Product release](../product-release)
- If you finish early, visit bonus section - [Automatic synchronizations](../autosync)

We will meet in the main room 30 minutes before the end to review what we've done and exchange our experience.
