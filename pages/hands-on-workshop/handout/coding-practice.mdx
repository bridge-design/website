If you didn't set up the repository yet, it's time to do it now! Follow our instructions at the [Repository Setup](../repo-setup) section.

As a developer, you will be working on **version 1** of your library. 
This is a large task, that we will be continuing tomorrow. We split it
to the following parts:

### Day 1:
1. Update design tokens
1. Process the tokens with Style Dictionary
1. Display design tokens in Storybook

### Day 2:
1. Update the components with tokens
1. Prepare to the release
1. Run visual regression tests

Let's start with first part.

## 1. Updating design tokens

If you want to sync with the design library, build Figma tokens.
You will use in components and product pages.
The tokens are exported from Figma in one click with
[Design Tokens plugin](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens). Once
you got `design-tokens.json` file from your designer, put it to
`design-system/tokens/design-tokens.json`.

### Under the tokens' hood

The exported is not very convenient for development, so we process
it with the help of [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/).
You can see the result in `design-system/src/tokens/dist/`. These are the
the files that will be imported into the components. You don't have to change
anything there, but it is good to know how
these things work.


## 2. Process the tokens with Style Dictionary

You can see in `design-system/src/tokens/dist/` how *color* and *typography*
tokens are displayed. But as you noticed, the `design-tokens.json` file has much
more information. For example, space tokens. Before you use them in the library,
you need a custom processing via Style Dictionary.

**Let's write a custom processing for spacing tokens.**

When new token files appear in your `dist` folder, they should be re-exported from the tokens folder. For example, to re-export spacing, you will need to add the following into `design-system/src/tokens/index.js`:

```
import * as spacing from "./dist/spacing";
```


## 3. Display design tokens in Storybook

Now you have spacing tokens as variables. The next step is to make them visible
in Storybook. Look at the stories for colors and typography as an example.

**Let's display spacing tokens.**


## That's it for today!
You can use the rest of the time to continue with this task. 5 minutes before the
end of the workshop, will meet at the main room for a quick summary of the first day.

Don't worry if you don't complete it all, we will be coding tomorrow as well. And call us for help if you have any difficulties!
Or if you finish early, you can look at the [next coding challenge](../preparing-release) and/or code some components.
