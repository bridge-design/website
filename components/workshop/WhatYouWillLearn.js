          This workshop helps you learn and practice design systems working in a team. You can join
          as a designer or developer.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The designers define visual design language and Figma components. At the same time, the
          developers create the components with React. You practice iterative component-driven
          design and development and create documentation along with making the product. The
          exercise contains managing collaborative updates and keeping the code in sync with the
          design reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the workshop, each team has a ready-to-use component library, an end product
          built out of that, and a tuned process to ensure smooth updates.
