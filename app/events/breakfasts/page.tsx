              learn cutting-edge ideas, and network over coffee?

              Enter <strong>Design Systems Breakfast!</strong> This is a relaxed morning gathering where you can 
              discuss early-stage topics, exchange experiences, and build connections in a friendly setting. 
              It's like catching up with colleagues over breakfast, but with fresh insights on design systems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              It started during COVID when everything went digital but we missed the friendly atmosphere of 
              in-person gatherings. While there were (and still are) many online meetups, many felt too formal 
              and structured. That's why we created something different.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              COVID has passed, but the design system community is now worldwide, so this event keeps living. 
              Here's what makes it special:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="text-lg space-y-3">
              <li><strong>üç≥ It's breakfast time</strong></li>
              <li>
                <strong>‚òï It's casual</strong> (People actually eat and drink coffee during the session! 
                Join us with your breakfast. Or without, as you wish :-)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>üí¨ We focus on networking and exchanging experiences while learning.</strong> This means 
                a lot of discussion.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>üöÄ It's often early-stage content</strong> (Topics that aren't YET at conferences, 
                because people bring ideas for early feedback. You can learn them first!)
              </li>
              <li><strong>üôÄ We don't record</strong> (That's a feature)</li>
