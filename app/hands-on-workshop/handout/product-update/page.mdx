<LayoutHandout title="Product Update">

Now the library is ready, and you can change your legacy product
code with the new fancy components, from the library you have just
released. But first we will need to update library version. Go to package.json of your product (`product/package.json`) and change the
version of the library:

```diff
  "dependencies": {
-   "design-system": "0.1.0",
+   "design-system": "0.2.0",
    ...
  }

```

Now you can change the product files to make use of your new components.
Keep product server running when making the changes to see them in action .

```
yarn product
```

### Goals

At this stage, your final goal is to replace the product legacy code
with the components. Overall you have 1 hour for the following tasks:

- Update your product with tokens (as described at this page)
- When your designers will share with you the design updates, which you will need to bring into your library and product. The process is described in the next section: [Cast in Code](../cast-in-code)
- Release the new version of library and product. Read here about [Product release](../product-release)
- If you finish early, visit bonus section - [Automatic synchronizations](../autosync)

We will meet in the main room 30 minutes before the end to review what we've done and exchange our experience.
