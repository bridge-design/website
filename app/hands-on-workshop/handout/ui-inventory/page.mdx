## What UI elements you need?

As a team, you have to define the scope of your future design system.
At the moment, you have a product with an interface that you would
keep as it is but "componentize".

You have some components in Figma, you have some components in code.
But some are missing. When your design system is ready, you should
have a set of components on the design side, same set on the code side,
and the product made out of them. But before you start designing and
coding, you need to understand what exactly each of you is doing. Figure
it out by analyzing the current status and identifying missing parts.

## Steps to analyze

- List what you have in Figma
- List what you have in code (Storybook)
- Are there intersections? Do the names match? "Merge" the lists chosing the right names.
- What are the components missing at all? What should be names for them?
- Prioritise the work, what you do first, what can wait?
- Assign the tasks

**NOTE**. Think carefully about your design foundation. Renaming tokens from
version to version might create extra work for the developers.

You can use a Miro board for your team work:

## Let's start!

You have approximately 45 minutes to complete UI inventory together with your team.
We will have lunch break straight away, and then will meet at 11:45 PST (14:45 EST) in the main
room to show and discuss our UI inventories. Don't hesitate to send messages on
Slack or invite us to your breakout room, if you want to clarify something.
